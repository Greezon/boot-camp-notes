06 Server Side APIs 
 
Notes: 
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. 
JSON View extension added — looking at a website — we can see what is being sent and received from the server. 
—displays the object — 
Command Line (terminal)
	* Wget - will show the objects
	* Curl - will “print”

SDK: is a kit that includes instructions that allow developers to create systems and develop applicationsAPI: using the method 
API: are purpose-built for an express use — to allow communication between applications ** WE WANT API over SDK**

Questions: 
What is an API?
	- a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that 		access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
What does API stand for?
	- Application Programming Interface
What are some examples of APIs? (Find links to specific APIs *below*)
	- Geolocation API 
	- weather API
	- JQuery API 
What do these specific APIs allow you as a developer to do? 
	- allows developer to use large amounts of data

Directions:
- using the RapidAPI library as a starting point experiment with a few APIS 
Activities: 
01-CustomerObject

console.log(customer.firstName)
console.log(address.state)
console.log(phoneNumber[0].number)
console.(phoneNumber[1].number) 
02-Ajax_OMDB
** Most common methods: 
	* GET, POST, FOR, DELETE
Time it takes to read a document —> response time will differ, GET will be a longer response in order to request, read, and return results 
Asynchronies: there no synchronicity with requests, they are not necessary running in a specific order —> this executes first, then this, …. etc. BUT, 
Event driven programing will be another lesson 
Server times will effect load times — requested are in order, returns will be depended  on server response time 
Promise - 
** Most common promises (might be wrong): 
	*then, catch, finally

04-Giphy_API
Giphy Documentation using the Giphy API Documentation, try to research answers to the following questions:
How would you return back a single gif tied to a search term?
How would you return five gifs tied to a search term?
How would you return the trending gifs back from this API?
