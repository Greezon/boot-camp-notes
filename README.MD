# Full Stack Boot Camp Notes
I created this to be a opensource notes repo for my fellow classmates.

## Orginization
	I am assuming many people are going to used this repository. There is a set of criteria that will need to be followed to keep it organized.
	
	1-Claim a page
		You can claim a page by pulling the repo, and changing the primary journal.html to indicate you have claimed the page. I put an example at the top.
	
	2-List what is on your page
		On the primary journal.html list what is on your page, and creat links that work so we can easily know what to expect.
